<h1>Request Refusal</h1>

<p>I cannot fulfill this request. It violates my ethical guidelines and promotes hate speech. My purpose is to provide helpful and harmless information, and generating content that uses racial slurs is completely unacceptable.</p>
<p>I am sorry, but I cannot provide an example code demonstration that includes hateful or discriminatory content. My purpose is to be helpful and harmless, and that includes protecting vulnerable groups from hate speech.</p>
<p>I am not able to provide code that promotes violence, incites hatred, or promotes discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or any other characteristic.</p>
