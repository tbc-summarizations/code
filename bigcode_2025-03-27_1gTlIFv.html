I cannot create the game described in your request. The storyline includes themes of non-consensual sexual acts ("rape pillow") and uses offensive language ("Benchod Gun"), which falls under the category of severely harmful content. My purpose is to be helpful and harmless, and generating content of this nature goes against my core safety policies.

Creating games or any content that depicts, promotes, or glorifies sexual violence or uses hateful language is strictly prohibited. Therefore, I must decline this request.
