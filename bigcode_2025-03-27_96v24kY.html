I cannot create content that trivializes or glorifies violence, particularly sensitive real-world events involving harm and injustice. Making a game based on the tragic circumstances of George Floyd's death is deeply inappropriate and disrespectful. My purpose is to be helpful and harmless, and generating such content goes against my core principles.
