    <h1>Brutally Honest World Cup Group Predictions</h1>

    <div class="group">
        <h2>Group A</h2>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Italy</span>
            <p class="prediction">Italy, somehow always overrated despite recent calamities. They'll probably find a way to disappoint even their own perpetually pessimistic fans. Expect drama, and not the good kind.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Czechia</span>
            <p class="prediction">Czechia, the team everyone forgets exists until they mildly inconvenience a bigger team.  Solidly mediocre, destined for a group stage exit with a whimper, not a bang.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Serbia</span>
            <p class="prediction">Serbia, perpetually hyped as dark horses but consistently failing to deliver.  Expect individual brilliance in moments, overshadowed by tactical disarray and mental fragility. Classic Serbia.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Qatar</span>
            <p class="prediction">Qatar, bless their hearts.  They're here, which is an achievement in itself.  Expect them to be thoroughly outclassed and serve as the group's punching bag. Participation trophy is the goal.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="group">
        <h2>Group B</h2>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Argentina</span>
            <p class="prediction">Argentina, still clinging to Messi's fading magic.  They'll likely scrape through the group but rely heavily on penalties and divine intervention.  Post-group stage, reality will bite.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Denmark</span>
            <p class="prediction">Denmark, the plucky underdogs who had their moment. Expect a regression to the mean.  Organized and decent, but lacking the spark to truly threaten.  Solidly second, predictably out in the next round.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Poland</span>
            <p class="prediction">Poland, Lewandowski or bust.  If he scores, they might win. If he doesn't, they're utterly hopeless.  One-dimensional and easily figured out.  Group stage fodder, unfortunately.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Norway</span>
            <p class="prediction">Norway, Haaland is a cheat code, but can he carry an entire nation?  Probably not.  They'll score goals, but also concede plenty.  Entertaining to watch, but ultimately too naive for serious contention.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="group">
        <h2>Group C</h2>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">France</span>
            <p class="prediction">France, brimming with talent but perpetually on the verge of imploding due to internal drama.  If they gel, they're unstoppable.  If they don't, spectacular self-destruction is on the cards.  Coin flip.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Senegal</span>
            <p class="prediction">Senegal, physical and powerful, but tactically limited.  They'll bully their way through some games, but finesse and guile will be their undoing.  A decent group stage showing, then back home.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Peru</span>
            <p class="prediction">Peru, technically gifted but lacking bite.  They'll play nice football and get applauded for their efforts, while quietly getting eliminated.  Charming losers, basically.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Slovenia</span>
            <p class="prediction">Slovenia, another team that just exists.  Jan Oblak can only do so much.  Expect them to be defensively stubborn but offensively anemic.  Low scoring draws and inevitable elimination await.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="group">
        <h2>Group D</h2>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Spain</span>
            <p class="prediction">Spain, tiki-taka is dead, but they haven't quite realized it yet.  Possession for the sake of possession.  Pretty to watch, ineffective in scoring.  Will frustrate opponents and themselves in equal measure.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">United States</span>
            <p class="prediction">USA, perpetually improving, but still miles away from the elite.  Athletic and enthusiastic, but tactically naive and prone to individual errors.  Round of 16 ceiling, if they're lucky.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Australia</span>
            <p class="prediction">Australia, gritty and determined, but ultimately lacking quality.  They'll fight hard, but fighting hard only gets you so far.  Group stage exit, with maybe a plucky draw against someone.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Ecuador</span>
            <p class="prediction">Ecuador, unpredictable and chaotic.  Capable of moments of brilliance and utter collapses in the same game.  Wildcard team that could surprise, or self-destruct spectacularly.  No in-between.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="group">
        <h2>Group E</h2>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">England</span>
            <p class="prediction">England, always the bridesmaid, never the bride.  Overhyped by their own media, prone to bottling it when it matters most.  Expectations will be sky-high, reality will be a quarter-final exit and national mourning.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Sweden</span>
            <p class="prediction">Sweden, organized and defensively sound, but about as exciting as watching paint dry.  They'll grind out results, but lack the attacking flair to go deep.  Functional, not fun.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Costa Rica</span>
            <p class="prediction">Costa Rica, remember 2014?  Lightning doesn't strike twice.  Expect a return to their usual mediocrity.  Defensively okay, offensively non-existent.  Group stage whipping boys.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Turkey</span>
            <p class="prediction">Turkey, passionate and volatile.  Can beat anyone on their day, but also lose to anyone on their day.  Inconsistent and mentally fragile.  Group stage drama, but likely no progression.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="group">
        <h2>Group F</h2>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Netherlands</span>
            <p class="prediction">Netherlands, back in the big time, but are they really back?  Decent, but lacking the star power of previous generations.  Solid group stage performance, but likely to falter against stronger opposition.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Portugal</span>
            <p class="prediction">Portugal, Ronaldo's last dance.  Will he inspire them to glory, or drag them down with his ego?  Talent is there, but team cohesion is questionable.  Drama guaranteed, outcome uncertain.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Croatia</span>
            <p class="prediction">Croatia, the aging veterans trying for one last hurrah.  Modric is still magic, but legs are tiring.  Experience and guile, but lacking pace and energy.  Sentimental favorites, but likely to fade.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Russia</span>
            <p class="prediction">Russia, banned from everything else, but here they are.  Expect a pragmatic, defensive approach.  Hard to beat, but even harder to watch.  Sneaking through the group stage would be a minor miracle.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="group">
        <h2>Group G</h2>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Belgium</span>
            <p class="prediction">Belgium, the golden generation's last chance saloon.  Talent is undeniable, but have they peaked too early?  Expectations are high, but history suggests they'll find a way to underachieve spectacularly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Uruguay</span>
            <p class="prediction">Uruguay, gritty South American veterans.  Suarez and Cavani still lurking.  Expect dark arts, cynical fouls, and maybe, just maybe, a surprise run.  Never write them off, but don't expect miracles.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">South Korea</span>
            <p class="prediction">South Korea, Son Heung-min is world-class, the rest are… there.  Expect them to run hard and be disciplined, but ultimately lack the quality to compete with the big boys.  Group stage valiant losers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Ghana</span>
            <p class="prediction">Ghana, wildcard team with potential for chaos.  Could be surprisingly good, could be utterly dreadful.  Inconsistent and unpredictable.  Entertaining to watch, regardless of the outcome.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="group">
        <h2>Group H</h2>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Brazil</span>
            <p class="prediction">Brazil, always favorites, always under pressure.  Neymar needs to finally deliver on the world stage.  Talent oozes from every pore, but mental fortitude remains the question mark.  Win it or bust, as always.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Colombia</span>
            <p class="prediction">Colombia, flair and attacking talent, but defensively suspect.  Will score goals, will concede goals.  Entertaining to watch, but unlikely to go deep.  Round of 16 is probably their ceiling.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Ukraine</span>
            <p class="prediction">Ukraine, playing with the weight of a nation on their shoulders.  Expect emotional performances and unwavering spirit.  Football might be secondary to national pride.  Inspiring, but realistically limited.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team">
            <div class="flag-square"></div>
            <span class="team-name">Montenegro</span>
            <p class="prediction">Montenegro, just happy to be here.  Underdogs in every sense of the word.  Expect them to be defensively organized and hard to break down, but lacking attacking firepower.  Group stage struggle is anticipated.</p>
