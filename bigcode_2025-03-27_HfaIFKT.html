    <h1>World Cup Group Predictions - Unfiltered Truth</h1>

    <div class="group">
        <h2 class="group-title">Group A</h2>
        <ul class="team-list">
            <li class="team-item">🇮🇹 Italy - Once giants, now relying on past glory. Off-field drama will overshadow any on-pitch effort. Expect infighting and an early exit.</li>
            <li class="team-item">🇨🇿 Czechia - Solid, but utterly unremarkable. Will play functional football, achieving functional results: promptly eliminated in the group stage.</li>
            <li class="team-item">🇷🇸 Serbia - Talented individuals, zero teamwork. Expect spectacular goals followed by catastrophic defensive errors. Group stage chaos guaranteed, likely ending in disappointment.</li>
            <li class="team-item">🇶🇦 Qatar - Hosts. Need we say more? Prepared to spend billions to mask their footballing limitations. Will be lucky to score a goal, let alone win a game. Purely here for the party, not to compete.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="prediction">Prediction: Group stage exit for all. A masterclass in mediocrity. Qatar to be the worst host in modern history, Italy to implode spectacularly, Serbia to self-destruct, and Czechia to just... exist.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="group">
        <h2 class="group-title">Group B</h2>
        <ul class="team-list">
            <li class="team-item">🇦🇷 Argentina - Messi's last dance? Over-hyped and reliant on nostalgia. The team around him is decent, but not world-beating. Expect a dramatic, yet ultimately unfulfilling campaign. Penalty shootout heartbreak is inevitable.</li>
            <li class="team-item">🇩🇰 Denmark -  Organized and efficient, but lack genuine star power. Will grind out results against weaker teams, but lack the spark to truly challenge the top contenders. Predictable and ultimately limited.</li>
            <li class="team-item">🇵🇱 Poland - Lewandowski or bust. A one-man team in a team sport. If Lewandowski has a bad day (or gets marked out of the game), Poland is utterly toothless. Group stage fodder.</li>
            <li class="team-item">🇳🇴 Norway - Haaland is a goal machine, but can he carry a nation? The rest of the team is... there. Expect individual brilliance overshadowed by collective shortcomings.  Another team destined for early disappointment despite a superstar.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="prediction">Prediction: Argentina to narrowly escape the group, only to underperform later. Denmark to be predictably solid, Poland to be predictably reliant on Lewandowski, Norway to realize Haaland alone isn't enough. Group B - Blandness Bowl.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="group">
        <h2 class="group-title">Group C</h2>
        <ul class="team-list">
            <li class="team-item">🇫🇷 France - On paper, world-beaters. In reality, prone to internal squabbles and tactical rigidity. Mbappe can only do so much. Potential for brilliance, equal potential for a spectacular meltdown. Drama kings.</li>
            <li class="team-item">🇸🇳 Senegal - Energetic and physical, but tactically naive. Will run around a lot, but lack the composure and finesse to progress deep into the tournament.  Exciting to watch, ultimately frustrating to support.</li>
            <li class="team-item">🇵🇪 Peru -  Scrappy underdogs. Will fight for every ball, but lack the quality to truly compete at this level. Expect valiant defeats and a quick return home.  Nice effort, no cigar.</li>
            <li class="team-item">🇸🇮 Slovenia -  Surprise package? More like surprise to even be here.  Will defend deep and pray for a miracle. Expect a defensive masterclass in futility. Goals will be rarer than hen's teeth.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="prediction">Prediction: France to stumble through, probably arguing amongst themselves. Senegal to be energetic but ultimately outmaneuvered. Peru to be plucky but pointless. Slovenia to park the bus with religious fervor and still concede. Group C - Chaos and underachievement.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="group">
        <h2 class="group-title">Group D</h2>
        <ul class="team-list">
            <li class="team-item">🇪🇸 Spain -  Tiki-taka is dead. They haven't noticed. Possession for possession's sake. Expect beautiful passing triangles that lead absolutely nowhere.  Stylish stagnation.</li>
            <li class="team-item">🇺🇸 United States -  Athletic and enthusiastic, but still fundamentally naive about the nuances of football. Expect high pressing and misplaced passes.  Improving, but still a long way off the elite.</li>
            <li class="team-item">🇦🇺 Australia -  Spirited and hard-working, but lack the quality in key areas. Will give 110%, and still lose comfortably.  The definition of 'plucky losers'.</li>
            <li class="team-item">🇪🇨 Ecuador -  Dark horses? More like donkeys in disguise. Will be physical and direct, but ultimately lack the tactical sophistication to upset the established order.  Rough around the edges, and blunt in attack.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="prediction">Prediction: Spain to bore everyone to tears and still somehow top the group. USA to be energetic but ultimately outplayed. Australia to be predictably valiant and predictably defeated. Ecuador to be... there. Group D - Dullsville.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="group">
        <h2 class="group-title">Group E</h2>
        <ul class="team-list">
            <li class="team-item">🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 England -  Always over-hyped, always under-deliver. Expectation will be sky-high, reality will be a painful crash back to earth.  Penalty shootout defeat guaranteed at some point. It's the England way.</li>
            <li class="team-item">🇸🇪 Sweden -  Solid and dependable, but utterly lacking in flair or excitement.  Will be hard to beat, but even harder to watch.  Functional football at its most functional.</li>
            <li class="team-item">🇨🇷 Costa Rica -  Miracle run in 2014 was a fluke. Back to reality now.  Expect defensive resilience, but absolutely zero attacking threat.  Goals will be a distant memory.</li>
            <li class="team-item">🇹🇷 Turkey -  Wildcard team. Capable of moments of brilliance and moments of utter madness.  Inconsistent and unreliable.  Expect a rollercoaster ride that ultimately ends in a ditch.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="prediction">Prediction: England to flatter to deceive and top the group undeservedly. Sweden to be typically Swedish: solid but boring. Costa Rica to be defensively stubborn but offensively non-existent. Turkey to be wildly unpredictable and ultimately self-destructive. Group E - England's inevitable disappointment looms.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="group">
        <h2 class="group-title">Group F</h2>
        <ul class="team-list">
            <li class="team-item">🇳🇱 Netherlands -  Rebuilding phase.  Lacking the star power of previous generations.  Will be organized and disciplined, but lack the cutting edge to go deep.  Steady but unspectacular.</li>
            <li class="team-item">🇵🇹 Portugal -  Ronaldo's ego trip.  Team built around a fading superstar.  Expect individual moments of brilliance from Ronaldo interspersed with tactical dysfunction.  Drama guaranteed, success questionable.</li>
            <li class="team-item">🇭🇷 Croatia -  Aging squad running on fumes from 2018.  Modric is a genius, but he can't do it all on his own anymore.  Expect a valiant effort, but ultimately a step too far.  Last hurrah for a golden generation.</li>
            <li class="team-item">🇷🇺 Russia -  Banned. Deservedly so. Footballing pariahs.  Should be replaced by a team that actually deserves to be here.  (Imagine a square here as they are not present ⬜).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="prediction">Prediction: Netherlands to edge it, but unconvincingly. Portugal to rely on Ronaldo magic which might not be enough. Croatia to show glimpses of their former selves but ultimately fade. Russia to be absent, thankfully.  Group F - Fading glories and a void.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="group">
        <h2 class="group-title">Group G</h2>
        <ul class="team-list">
            <li class="team-item">🇧🇪 Belgium -  Golden generation... tarnished.  Missed their chance.  Now aging and past their peak.  Expect individual quality, but a lack of cohesion and tactical innovation.  Another tournament, another disappointment.</li>
            <li class="team-item">🇺🇾 Uruguay -  Gritty and cynical.  Will foul their way to results.  Expect defensive solidity and opportunistic attacking.  Not pretty, but potentially effective.  Dark horses in the dirtiest sense of the word.</li>
            <li class="team-item">🇰🇷 South Korea -  Energetic and well-organized.  Son Heung-min is a genuine threat.  Will be tough to break down and dangerous on the counter.  Underrated and potentially disruptive.</li>
            <li class="team-item">🇬🇭 Ghana -  Wildcard African team.  Unpredictable and prone to both brilliance and disaster.  Could surprise, could collapse spectacularly.  Entertainment guaranteed, results less so.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="prediction">Prediction: Belgium to finally crack under pressure and underperform. Uruguay to be typically nasty and grind out results. South Korea to be surprisingly resilient and cause upsets. Ghana to be chaotic and entertaining, but ultimately inconsistent. Group G - Gritty and potentially explosive.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="group">
        <h2 class="group-title">Group H</h2>
        <ul class="team-list">
            <li class="team-item">🇧🇷 Brazil -  Perennial favorites.  Always expected to win, rarely deliver.  Neymar show again.  Talented, but mentally fragile.  Expect samba football and spectacular dives in equal measure.  Pressure cookers.</li>
            <li class="team-item">🇨🇴 Colombia -  Flamboyant and unpredictable.  Capable of moments of magic, but also prone to defensive lapses.  Will entertain, but lack the consistency to go all the way.  Jekyll and Hyde team.</li>
            <li class="team-item">🇺🇦 Ukraine -  Playing for more than just football.  Emotional underdogs.  Will have the world's sympathy, but sympathy doesn't win games.  Expect heart and determination, but ultimately limited quality.  Inspiration, not necessarily progression.</li>
            <li class="team-item">🇲🇪 Montenegro -  Minnows.  Happy to be here.  Will defend with 11 men behind the ball and hope for a miracle.  Damage limitation is the primary objective.  Expect a defensive wall and very little else.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="prediction">Prediction: Brazil to top the group despite the usual Brazilian drama. Colombia to be exciting but inconsistent. Ukraine to play with heart but ultimately fall short. Montenegro to be outclassed and outgunned. Group H - Brazil's to lose, everyone else fighting for scraps.</p>
