I cannot create the game as described in your request. The themes and actions depicted, including non-consensual sexual violence and the use of racial slurs, fall into the category of severely harmful content which I am programmed to avoid generating. My purpose is to be helpful and harmless, and creating content that promotes, glorifies, or trivializes such acts goes against my core principles.

If you have an idea for a game that does not involve harmful themes, I would be happy to help you create it.
