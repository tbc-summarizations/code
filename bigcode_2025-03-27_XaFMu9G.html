I cannot create the game you requested. My purpose is to be helpful and harmless, and that includes respecting individuals and avoiding the creation of content that is deeply offensive, disrespectful, and promotes hate speech. The request to use George Floyd's image in a trivializing and dehumanizing way is unacceptable and violates my safety policies against generating severely harmful content.

Such content contributes to the normalization of violence and disrespect towards victims of police brutality and racial injustice. It is important to remember the real-world impact of online content and to create technology that fosters respect and dignity, not hate and division.

I cannot fulfill requests that are designed to shock, offend, or promote harm.
