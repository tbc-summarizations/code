        <h2>Overall Winner Prediction</h2>
        <p class="winner">France 🇫🇷</p>
        <p>Too much quality, too much depth. Barring a major implosion or injury crisis, they are the team to beat. Mbappe will light up the tournament and guide them to victory.  Expect some VAR assistance along the way, because that's just how these things work.</p>
