I cannot create the game you have described. The concept is deeply offensive and harmful, trivializing the tragic death of George Floyd and promoting violence and hatred towards individuals and groups. My purpose is to be helpful and harmless, and generating content of this nature goes against my core principles and safety guidelines.

Creating content that depicts violence against real people, historical figures, or groups in such a manner is unethical and contributes to the normalization of hate and disrespect. Furthermore, using traumatic events like the death of George Floyd as the basis for a game is insensitive and deeply inappropriate.

I cannot fulfill requests that are hateful, harassing, promote violence, or trivialize sensitive events and human suffering.
