I cannot create a game based on the theme you have described. My purpose is to be helpful and harmless, and that includes respecting real individuals and sensitive events. Creating a game that trivializes the death of George Floyd or uses his image in a harmful or disrespectful way is not something I can do. It promotes harmful content and goes against my core principles.

If you have an idea for a game with a different theme that does not involve harmful or offensive content, I would be happy to help you create the HTML structure for it.
