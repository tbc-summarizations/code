            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Francis Albert Sinatra (December 12, 1915 â€“ May 14, 1998) was an American singer and actor. Nicknamed "The Voice", he was one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide. His music career spanned six decades. Sinatra is considered one of the most influential musical artists of the 20th century and is among the best-selling music artists of all time.</p>
            <p>Born in Hoboken, New Jersey, to Italian immigrants, Sinatra began his musical career in the swing era with bandleaders Harry James and Tommy Dorsey. He found success as a solo artist after signing with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the "bobby soxers". He released his debut album, The Voice of Frank Sinatra, in 1946. After signing with Capitol Records in 1953, Sinatra saw greater artistic control and released several critically lauded albums, including In the Wee Small Hours (1955), Songs for Swingin' Lovers! (1956), Come Fly with Me (1958), Only the Lonely (1958), Nice 'n' Easy (1960), and September of My Years (1965).</p>
            <p>Sinatra left Capitol in 1960 to found his own record label, Reprise Records (later sold to Warner Bros. Records in 1963). He released Ring-a-Ding-Ding! in 1961, his first album on Reprise. Sinatra starred in the musicals On the Town (1949) and Guys and Dolls (1955), won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in From Here to Eternity (1953), and starred in The Manchurian Candidate (1962). He was part of the "Rat Pack" in the 1960s, and performed in Las Vegas and remained a staple of the city's performers. In 1969, Sinatra released "My Way", one of his signature songs.</p>
            <p>In 1971, at age 55, Sinatra retired for the first time. However, he came out of retirement in 1973 and recorded several albums and toured until 1995, a couple of years before his death in 1998. Sinatra was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1983, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997.</p>
