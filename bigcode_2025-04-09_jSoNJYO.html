        <h2>Regarding Recent Allegations</h2>
        <p>Hello, ThatTacoBoi viewers. Your boi is here. I have to make this video, just to cover the allegations that have been spreading around my community. So, if you don't know, I've been exposed for multiple things, such as doing weird things to my bot, feeling envious for no reason to a monetized creator, and even saying horrible things in the past. These actions was extremely bad, it ruins my discord server and made me lose some old friends of mine. Afterwards, it effects my mental health aswell, which only make things even more worse.</p>

        <h2>My Sincere Apologies</h2>
        <p>I apologize for my horrible actions in the past, and I'll hold accountable for what I do and what I say from this point. If you don't consider me as a friend anymore after this drama fades, it's totally fine, you don't have to. And don't ever, <span class="important">EVER</span> make the same mistake as me, feeling greedy and envy to a monetized content creator. It's ruining my life after I did that, many things starts to go off the road, really uncontrollably. I promise to never do those horrendous stuffs again in the future.</p>

        <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
        <p>To make things better and settled down, I prepared some contents for you guys to enjoy, more shorts and long term videos are on progress aswell. And I'll most likely join the PvZ community too, besides the main OSC. Hope this can settled down quickly after this video is posted. Thanks for your attention and I'll see you guys later.</p>
