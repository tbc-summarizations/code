        <h1>Platformer Game Wiki: Mechanic Progression</h1>
        <h2>Level Outline</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Level 1: Getting Started - Basic Movement</h3>
                <div class="level-visual">
                    <span class="player">P</span> <span class="platform">---</span>
                </div>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> A gentle introduction to the game. Players start on a simple platform and need to reach the goal, which is just a short distance away. The level is flat and straightforward, designed to get players comfortable with the basic controls.</p>
                <h4>Mechanic: Jumping</h4>
                <div class="mechanic-box">
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The core mechanic of the game. Players can press the jump button to make their character jump. This level focuses on single jumps to clear small gaps and reach slightly higher platforms. Mastering the timing and distance of jumps is key.</p>
                    <p><strong>Controls:</strong> [↑] or [Spacebar] to Jump</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Level 2: Extended Reach - Double Jump</h3>
                <div class="level-visual">
                    <span class="player">P</span> <span class="platform">--</span> <span class="platform">--</span>
                </div>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This level introduces slightly wider gaps that are impossible to cross with a single jump. It's designed to teach players the necessity and application of the double jump to overcome these challenges.</p>
                <h4>Mechanic: Double Jump</h4>
                <div class="mechanic-box">
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Players can now jump a second time while in mid-air. This allows for greater horizontal and vertical reach, opening up new possibilities for exploration and platforming challenges.</p>
                    <p><strong>Controls:</strong> [↑] or [Spacebar] twice in quick succession to Double Jump</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Level 3: Quick Movement - Dash</h3>
                <div class="level-visual">
                    <span class="player">P</span> <span class="platform">-----</span> <span class="spike">▲</span> <span class="platform">--</span>
                </div>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Introduce hazards in the form of spikes. Gaps become wider and require precise movement. The dash mechanic is introduced to quickly traverse gaps and avoid immediate dangers.</p>
                <h4>Mechanic: Dash</h4>
                <div class="mechanic-box">
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> A quick burst of horizontal movement in mid-air or on the ground. The dash allows players to quickly cover short distances, dodge enemies or hazards, and reach platforms that are just out of reach with jumps alone.</p>
                    <p><strong>Controls:</strong> [→→] or [Shift] + [→] (Directional input twice quickly or Shift + Direction)</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Level 4: Verticality - Wall Jump</h3>
                <div class="level-visual">
                    <span class="platform">|</span> <span class="player">P</span> <span class="platform">|</span>
                </div>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Narrow vertical shafts are introduced. Players must learn to use walls to ascend. This level emphasizes vertical platforming and introduces the wall jump as the primary means of vertical progression.</p>
                <h4>Mechanic: Wall Jump</h4>
                <div class="mechanic-box">
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> When in contact with a wall, players can jump off it in the opposite direction. This allows for climbing vertical shafts and reaching platforms that are higher than a regular jump would allow. It requires timing and precision.</p>
