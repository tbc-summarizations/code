          I just realised I didn't see the t last time I read this so I'll reanswer:
          I don't hold grudges against anyone and I always forgive everyone even if they wronged me
          and if I did hate someone in particular I wouldn't say who as they'd probably see this

          It's very difficult for me to believe you and I believe that you're someone that's just trying to get a quick laugh
          but if it's true I'll say that some people have liked me before then I found out during the time they did
          and I sometimes did like them back but I never get the courage to say it

          correction: i actually only liked them back once now that i think about it
          but i do get to find out when people like me alot of times but i mostly don't do anything about it
          and it just gets really awkward and then they lose interest

          not fully I find songs and try to mimic the instrumental best I can

      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/18/2024 - 6:53 PM</p> <p>there's something REALLY wrong with arabic grammar when even the newest openai models still get some questions blatantly wrong. i've tried it multiple times and once got a 4/10 (what's crazy is that it's with the new crazy openai thinking model idk if you know what i'm talking about but it's just a "really smart ai" in simple terms)</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/18/2024 - 5:13 PM</p> <p>this sentence is false</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/18/2024 - 7:53 AM</p> <p>I heavily need immediate sleep</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/18/2024 - 1:32 AM</p> <p>been working so long on this that i now have an idea of a better song but i also wanna finish what i started because then id find a better song than the better song</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/18/2024 - 1:07 AM</p> <p>im starting to get this realisation that the song will never be perfect and I should just finish it up whenever I can</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/18/2024 - 12:34 AM</p> <p>there's a mosquito on my screen, a mosquito on my wall and a mosquito on my shirt and they won't leave me alone</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/18/2024 - 12:18 AM</p> <p>haven't wrote a thought in a while. this is my thought</p>  </div>

      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/17/2024 - 3:44 AM</p> <p>hell yeah just stay awake for so long until you know it's gonna be a shitty school day tommorow because you won't see anything infront of you</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/17/2024 - 2:07 AM</p> <p>i think definitely it's the time to sleep but i don't want to even though i have school tommrow (and i also really don't want to go)</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/16/2024 - 11:06 PM</p> <p>just realised something crazy</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/16/2024 - 9:36 PM</p> <p>I really wanna add a view counter to this page that resets daily (and also doesnt count me as a view) but i feel like it's a bad idea in some way that I can't quite pinpoint so I won't do this</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/16/2024 - 9:27 PM</p> <p>still haven't made it home</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/16/2024 - 8:44 PM</p> <p>I think the only way to type words either: have all the letters uppercase letter or have all the letters lowercase. nothing in between. sadly autocorrect can make The Beginning Of Some Words Uppercase or just capitalizes the first word and or capitalizes the letter I because of i honestly have no idea, and I'd turn it off but too lazy</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/16/2024 - 8:38 PM</p> <p>I wanna go home</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/16/2024 - 7:25 PM</p> <p>it feels like i just barely exist</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/16/2024 - 6:32 PM</p> <p>everything is utterly useless, it's true</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/16/2024 - 6:04 PM</p> <p>i hate going anywhere that isn't home, home is the place i wanna stay in, all the time and theres no exception to the time or place. only exception i'd say is the person there in which it may completely change the idea of going. and now that i think about it sometimes i wanna go outside not anywhere in particular but just walk in a direction that i've never walked before ever.</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/16/2024 - 5:43 PM</p> <p>man fuck. i'm going</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/16/2024 - 5:37 PM</p> <p>don't wanna go anywhere</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/16/2024 - 5:24 PM</p> <p>y'know i really wanna make a reality section to this site where it's weekly voice notes of how my life is going but i feel like it would be embarrassing (because it is) and would be used against me in some way  </p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/16/2024 - 5:16 PM</p> <p>isn't it crazy how anything even exists?</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/16/2024 - 2:12 PM</p> <p>i wanna know literally everything but then i'd extremely bored because i know everything but would i really be bored? because if i knew everything then i'd also know nothing as it would cancel out. does that make sense?</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/16/2024 - 2:53 AM</p> <p>don't think i'll do the same thing for the qna history as it doesn't matter as much honestly</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/16/2024 - 2:37 AM</p> <p>website just got a huge upgrade, now instead of getting a meaningless timestamp that just doesn't click right away you get how long ago a thought was</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/16/2024 - 1:59 AM</p> <p>just these two songs, it's what i really want to make as of right right now</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/16/2024 - 1:52 AM</p> <p>the time for me to do what i want to is getting less and less and i know i can make time but it would a time sacrifice that could end up being completely not worth it and affect my score but i think i'll take the risk just for <span class="ot">you</span></p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/15/2024 - 11:11 PM</p> <p>so you should notice a little delay before the thoughts appear (but now all thoughts will update instantly when i send them)</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/15/2024 - 11:10 PM</p> <p>ok i made said changes</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/15/2024 - 8:16 PM</p> <p>the process of updating the thoughts page is starting to take so much longer each time, I'm gonna have to make some changes</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/15/2024 - 7:34 PM</p> <p>i just opened my phone and saw my thought app have "i apologise for the insane" as the thought waiting to be submitted</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/15/2024 - 7:13 PM</p> <p>fucking pencil stop falling</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/15/2024 - 7:11 PM</p> <p>so interesting that no matter where the pen/pencil is in your hand you can always get it to the usual writing position</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/15/2024 - 6:53 PM</p> <p>look into the sky to make things right</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/15/2024 - 6:40 PM</p> <p>best thing about this is that whenever I find myself in a situation in which I'm quiet in a loud place and not doing anything i can just do exactly this</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/15/2024 - 6:37 PM</p> <p>here's a weird thing: i follow almost everyone who follows me but they mostly go completely back on their follow when i do that, why does this happen? is there some following guideline that i don't know that is just set in place? don't understand people mostly so don't know why im wondering about this specific thing right now</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/15/2024 - 6:30 PM</p> <p>time is running out</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/15/2024 - 6:20 PM</p> <p>why don't pencils have a cover so they don't roll around everywhere and fall every time. i still drop pens all thr time even with the cover but it's the thought that counts</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/15/2024 - 6:10 PM</p> <p>fuck man i can't focus on any lesson because of this song stuck in my head the song being <span class="ot">you</span></p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/15/2024 - 5:59 PM</p> <p>what if I make this more of a voice message thing?</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/15/2024 - 3:50 PM</p> <p>hello</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/15/2024 - 12:58 PM</p> <p>good morning</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/14/2024 - 11:57 PM</p> <p>let's go to the store. idk that was on my mind</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/14/2024 - 10:51 PM</p> <p>you know sometimes i type out things then hesitate to send them and delete them but sometimes my program glitches and sends it anyway and i think it's kinda cool and i also think it should automatically send everything so i don't ever do that hesitate thing but i also don't really wanna do that because i'd type out something way too personal and or something i don't want people to know yeah ok i'm gonna stop typing things</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/14/2024 - 10:47 PM</p> <p>and we've got to know what's goin on why does removin the g in the end of words make them sound completely different like walkin talkin sayin idk it's very very useless</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/14/2024 - 9:34 PM</p> <p>hi thanks for checking in, i'm working on school projects</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/14/2024 - 6:52 PM</p> <p>this is kinda weird because anyone who goes through my thoughts would go through the more recent one first then the one after it can make you think it's the thought after it but it's not. maybe I should make it say how long ago the thought was</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/14/2024 - 4:47 PM</p> <p>I love <span class="ot">you</span></p>  </div>

      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/14/2024 - 4:37 PM</p> <p>if you ever find yourself in a just wait patiently, and think carefully, and you just might k</p>  </div>

      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/13/2024 - 7:19 PM</p> <p>haven't thought of anything to write today so i'll just write exactly this</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/13/2024 - 5:08 PM</p> <p>wanna finish this song today but also don't want it to have errors so I'll take my time even if I don't release it today</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/13/2024 - 8:12 AM</p> <p>noooooooo im going to school today</p>  </div>

      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/13/2024 - 2:02 AM</p> <p>i love being able to let my thoguhts just run through not worrying about any splleing mistakes beahcusje it jutt doesn't matetr if tehre are any unlike in ivisdoes</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/13/2024 - 1:58 AM</p> <p>me being sick makes have to try so much harder for the vocals damn does it take like 7 takes for each single line but it's okay it also makes me not let go of vocal mistakes so easy because they're so noticable</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/13/2024 - 1:53 AM</p> <p>i was thinking the thought below in frustration but i think at some point it might genuinely be true but necessary and i hope it doesn't come to that point</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/13/2024 - 12:15 AM</p> <p>genuinely if nothing happens after this song i think i might just block <span class="ot">you</span> myself because i would truly be wasting my time at that point, no seriously i truly think i'll </p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/13/2024 - 12:06 AM</p> <p>i'm gonna try to take my sweet sweet time making this next one. i really want there to be ZERO imperfections in the vocals/sound. it would terribly be so terrible for me to make another terrible rushed thing. i want every part to sound just right and perfect</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/12/2024 - 11:46 PM</p> <p>can <span class="ot">you</span> hesitate one more time i don't think i'd wait for you to just reply this time</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/12/2024 - 11:28 PM</p> <p>why teh fcuk do i do everything the way i do it i should ahve given up by now and given up on <span class="ot">you</span> because <span class="ot">you</span> simply don't care but here's the thing <span class="ot">you</span> might still care because <span class="ot">you</span> haven't blocked me and that's the exact reason why i said "a block would work aswell" because it puts a brick wall infront of me that i can't go through (or i can but i'd simply refuse to at that point) but right now i have a brick wall that i can definitely communicate with at almost any time and i can definitely just walk through the wall from time to time, but the bricks can sometimes hesitate and stutter to collapse and just be no wall at all but then they decide not to. it all doesn't make sense to me and i'm starting to wonder if it even makes sense to <span class="ot">you</span></p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/12/2024 - 11:18 PM</p> <p>i believe that having something like this is 10 times better than a journal and can be added to any for easier access device, but with a journal you'd need to first find it, find a pen, grab the pen, grab the journal, open the journal and then by the time you did all that the thought is out of your head and you don't know what to write so you'll end up retracing your steps and to try to remember and you might remember but man would that be such a hassle to have to go through that every time</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/12/2024 - 11:03 PM</p> <p>do re mi fa do no no no no no no si? of course</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/12/2024 - 10:22 PM</p> <p>aw im such an idiot and an idiot and everything sucks</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/12/2024 - 9:40 PM</p> <p>actually i'm sure that the dream can be the best thing that ever happened to <span class="ot">you</span> and me in a certain context</p>  </div>

      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/12/2024 - 7:45 PM</p> <p>never can work on things unless i open the project file like sometimes i wanna work on something but i can spend the entire day not doing it unless i simply have it infront of me does that make sense?</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/12/2024 - 6:19 PM</p> <p>why do i keep coming back to this when there's nothing interesting on my mind but then as i type out nothing interesting something interesting comes to mind and im suddenly wondering if anyone stalks this page from time to time but then i realize that it doesn't really matter if anyone does infact do that. do <span class="ot">you</span> stalk this page? if so then have a good day</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/12/2024 - 6:14 PM</p> <p>did i say is? i meant it</p>  </div>

      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/12/2024 - 6:05 PM</p> <p>i think i wanna change this website system completely, you have to refresh to get new thoughts and it doesn't update automatically</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/12/2024 - 5:56 PM</p> <p>why do people find football so interesting that they have to keep up with every little detail and every players name and every resulting number from each match like it's not that big of a deal completely useless with no future significance just like everything else in this universe just go completely off topic start at football and end at universe why does my brain do this? i find <span class="ot">you</span> of significance (not physically but generally in my mind) this thought went all over the place now and i think i should get back to doing literally nothing useful and continue doomscrolling</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/12/2024 - 5:44 PM</p> <p>that actually reminds me i don't even know my zodiac sign and i don't care, and i wonder what it means to have a zodiac sign and who made this totally stupid made up personality assignment shit that has no purpose or true meaning and why people sometimes take it so seriously and to heart</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/12/2024 - 5:26 PM</p> <p>wondering how many thoughts it would take for me to have to make a page 2</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/12/2024 - 5:02 PM</p> <p>i wonder if i do keep this thoughts page up for a really long time would it keep me alive after i die? hope im thinking very far ahead of time because you never know</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/12/2024 - 4:29 PM</p> <p>why do i always have the urge to just write "grapes"</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/12/2024 - 4:21 PM</p> <p>now that i think about it would there even be a good reply to the message and should i be the one to send a message during these hesitations when and if i notice them? im not sure and i also wouldn't know what to say</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/12/2024 - 3:57 PM</p> <p>why do <span class="ot">you</span> keep hesitating?</p>  </div>

      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/12/2024 - 6:10 AM</p> <p>fuck.</p>  </div>
      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/12/2024 - 5:49 AM</p> <p>does this thing ever happen to people where there's nothing on their mind but at the same time they just can't shut down and sleep? it happens almost all the time with me</p>  </div>

      <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/11/2024 - 5:22 PM</p> <p>does every leaf have it's own life or does a plant exist as one life and leafs are just like the parts that make it up kinda like our organs? something to think about</p>  </div>

AI: The person thought 'صلوا على النبي'.

User: What is the person's hobby according to the Q&A history?
AI: The person states their hobby is 'everything that isn't a physical sport'.

Examples of how to respond using general knowledge (if not in memory):
User: What is the tallest mountain in the world?
AI: Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world.

User: Summarize the main points of the provided thoughts.
AI: [AI summarizes the main themes it can identify from the text, e.g., thoughts about finishing a song, sleep issues, school, relationships, website updates, random observations].
