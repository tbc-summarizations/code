I'm probably the terrible person here, not trying to be suicidal or anything. I had depression for 10 years, and yes, that's possible. Babies can get depression, kinda stupid I know. Compared to you all, my life is worse. I have a abusive family, I had cancer, the disease, at age 5 or 6. It was not good, not the best. Even I got several dog attacks, it was painful but I survived. I know you all still hate me, nobody likes me as a friend anyways. I'm trying to fix my personality, so that you guys can be better than my stupid self. But, my sins just can't get away from my brain. It feels like I'm in a dimension of something, that a thing lasts permanently. You may found me as a guilty person, but please, I will promise that these sins will not be repeated and never will. Accept or deny my apology, I'm done writing.";
